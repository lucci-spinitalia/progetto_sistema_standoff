# configuration of PDO identifier
# configuration of PDO transmission type and transmission rate
# configuration of the autostart behaviour
# storing the data in the non-volatile memory of the device

# of the communication profile. The device is set to pre-operational state firs

# the data bytes 5 and 6 of message no. 2 define the identifier (330h in this
# example). Olease note that the value is transmitted LSB first

# In the next step the first transmit PDO is configured as event triggered and 
# the associated cyclic timer is programmed

# The data bytes 5 and 6 of message n. 6 define the timer repetition rate in multiples 
# of 1 millisecond (64h = 100 ms). Please note that the value is transmitted LSB first

# Now the device is configured to start PDO data transmission just after power up
# (no NMT start command required)
